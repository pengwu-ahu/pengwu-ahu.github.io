I am a professor at [iSchool](http://ischool.njust.edu.cn/) of Nanjing University of Science and Technology [(NJUST)](http://english.njust.edu.cn/). I received PhD degree of Information Science from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/), China. I have published more than 100 [publications](https://chengzhizhang.github.io/papers/), including JASIST, IPM, LISR, TFSC, Aslib JIM, JOI, OIR, SCIM, ACL, NAACL, etc. I [serve](https://chengzhizhang.github.io/service/) as Associate Editor of Heliyon (Information Science), Editorial Board Member and Managing Guest Editor for 10 international journals (Patterns, IPM, SCIM, OIR, Aslib JIM, TEL, IDD, NLE, JDIS, DIM, DI, etc.) and PC members of several international conferences (ACL, IJCAI, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL, AACL, IJCNLP, NLPCC, ASIS&T, JCDL, iConference, ISSI, etc.) in fields of natural language process and scientometrics.
My research fields include information retrieval, information organization, text mining and nature language processing. Currently, I am focusing on [scientific text mining](https://chengzhizhang.github.io/research/#scientific-text-mining), [knowledge entity extraction and evaluation](https://chengzhizhang.github.io/research/#knowledge-entity-extraction-and-evaluation
), [keyphrase extraction](https://chengzhizhang.github.io/research/#keyphrase-extraction), [social media mining](https://chengzhizhang.github.io/research/#social-media-mining). 

I was a visiting scholar in the [School of Computing and Information](https://www.sci.pitt.edu/) at the [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.pitt.edu/) and in the [Department of Linguistics and Translation](http://lt.cityu.edu.hk/) at the [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/).

I am the leader of [IR&TM Group](https://chengzhizhang.github.io/collaborators/) at NJUST.
