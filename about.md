I am an Associate Professor at [the School of Business, Anhui University (AHU)](https://sba.ahu.edu.cn/), China. I hold a PhD in Statistics from Anhui University and have published over 20 SCI/SSCI-indexed papers as lead or corresponding author in top-tier journals, including IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems (TFS), Information Fusion (INFFUS), Computers & Industrial Engineering (CAIE), Applied Soft Computing (ASOC), and Information Processing & Management (IPM).

I serve as an active reviewer for several prestigious journals, such as the Journal of Business Research, Annals of Operations Research, and IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, contributing to the peer-review process in my field.

My research focuses on:

Business Big Data Analytics & Mining

AI-Driven Business Decision-Making & Prediction

Large Language Models (LLMs) for Business Applications

I am particularly interested in developing data-driven AI models to enhance business intelligence, operational efficiency, and strategic decision-making.
